# Glassnode API Connector

A simple Python connector for the Glassnode REST API with the free Standard plan (only 24h resolution). Be sure to see their [subscription plans](https://studio.glassnode.com/pricing) and their [API documentation](https://docs.glassnode.com/) first to understand how it works.

- **glassnode.py** is the API connector itself 
- **test.py** gives a simple example of its application. Run it and see.	

__Make sure you generate and plug in your own API key first, or it will not work!__
